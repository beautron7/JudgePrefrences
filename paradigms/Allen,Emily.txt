  I did LD at Grapevine High School for three years, and have judged off and on since 2008. 

I try and flow as much as possible. However, I have horrible handwriting and the attention span of a four year old on crack, so my flows usually end up messy, disorganized, and generally incomprehensible. For this reason, the clearer you speak, the better. 

Please don't spread ridiculously fast if you are reading complex philosophical arguments or have a complicated frame work, because if I don't understand it in the AC/NC, I will feel sketchy voting on it later in the round when it has become oh-so-clear. So prease slow down :) 

I don't like theory. Sorry. This is the part where I hella intervene. I'm not super familiar with the structures of it since I didn't run it in HS, and while its necessary occasionally, I feel like people run it to be lazy or because they don't know how to actually respond to an argument on a substantial level. I'm not saying I won't ever vote on it, but you have to do a lot of work to demonstrate that real abuse has occurred.
