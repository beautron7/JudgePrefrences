  I am a college student now. <ldexp2><pfexp2>I debated LD and PF in high school.</pfexp2></ldexp2> I weigh quantifiable evidence directly pertaining to the topic more heavily than philosophy, and much more heavily than theory. <s0>I prefer a slow to moderate pace- no spreading please!</s0> I look for high quality evidence from respectable sources. Keep cross ex civil please, and don't cry abuse for things that are clearly within the rules for LD. Good luck!
