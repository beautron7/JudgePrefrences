<exp4>I have done speech and debate since I was 12. I have done policy, LD, extemp, and interp at the high school and college level.</exp4>

<s4>Speed - I have heard the fastest debaters and I have heard people who think that they are fast and there is a clear difference. I can judge and flow at any speed which is actually within your range. If you can't handle it, believe me, you will accomplish much more if you slow down a bit. It is embarrassing for all of us if you are spreading gibberish. On the other hand if speed is a talent of yours then I am all for using what you have to win a round. It's legit.</s4> - Debate is supposed to accomplish what everyone outside of debate fails to do. I hate it when debate devolves. I hate smoke and mirrors. <tru>I hate foolish arguments.</tru> It is very difficult to trick me so you're better off trying to trick your opponent. It is okay to lose an argument so long as you don't concede the round; this is to say to make yourself look dumb by failing to recognize what you've lost. Instead of wasting your few precious moments to make up my mind scrapping for pennies, use them to explain what you have won and why that affords you the W.Persona - I expect to see good sportsmanship. I will be the judge. You focus on the arguments I will follow the debaters. Just as in any sport you want to ensure your victory, but no one benefits from getting picked on or humiliated. On a related note I don't award points for experience. I am more than willing to let a seasoned debater lose to one who isn't yet familiar with the game, but who argues intelligently.Tactics - <tabras>I like and will vote on any win condition as long as it is justified.</tabras> Leave new arguments before the 1st rebuttal so that they can be talked out. CX is huge and it is binding.Misc. - I like to be entertained. Whether you are witty, sharp, knowledgeable, animated, comedic or whatever, use it to help show your grasp of the round and the arguments.
